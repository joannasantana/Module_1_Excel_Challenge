# Module_1_Excel_Challenge
Crowdfunding analysis project in Excel

Background:

Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. For this week's Challenge, you will organize and analyze a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.

Excel skills demonstrated:

-conditional formatting

-column creation

-basic arithmatic functions (sum, product, etc.)

-statistical analysis by calculating measures of central tendency (mean, standard deviation, variance)

-pivot tables

-pivot charts (stacked column charts, line charts)

-timestamp to date conversion

-COUNTIFS

-nested functions

Written analysis report includes conclusions from data, limitations identified in data, comparisons in variability for successful vs failed crowdfunding projects, and suggestions for additional data analysis that could be done to gain more valuable information from the dataset.
